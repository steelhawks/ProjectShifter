ProjectShifter
==============

Team 2601's summer drivetrain project.

To do:
- [x] Port to command-based model
- [x] Fix shifting toggle (probably not an issue with the Spike) - should be easy to resolve with the above
- [ ] Convert to Singleton pattern
- [x] Extend RobotDrive for 6CIMs (optional)
- [ ] Add inertia controls
- [ ] Add encoder feedback (PID control, moving in a straight line)
- [x] Adapt buttons/joysticks for gamepad
- [x] Try CheesyDrive
